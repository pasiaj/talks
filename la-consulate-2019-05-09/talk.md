##Background on Finnish industry
- Image: All Finnish gaming companies

I'm trying to show you some takes on the creation of the Finnish game industry success.

But just so you understand what I mean when I say "Finnish game industry success", I'm going to show you a couple of figures.

Mobile game industry is the most competitive industry in the history of the world.

In 2016 50.000 companies and creators added roughly 230.000 new products in to the Apple iOS App store.

That year, the mobile gaming generated about 40 billion dollars of revenues.

Finland is a nation of 5M people, that's less than one tenth of one procent of the global population.

That year Finnish game companies generated more than $2 billion dollars of revenue. About 5% of the global total.

With only 3000 employees. That's 666-hundred-thousand dollars per employee, on average.
